# Overview

Asana offers a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, accessible via app integration, which allows AI assistants and other
applications to access the Asana Work Graph from beyond the Asana platform. This server provides a way to interact with
your Asana workspace through various AI platforms and tools that support MCP.

With this server, Asana customers can:

1. Access Asana data from compatible AI applications
2. Create and manage tasks and projects through natural language
3. Generate reports and summaries based on Asana data
4. Analyze project data and get AI-powered suggestions

Example requests users could make from outside Asana using the MCP:

1. "Find all my incomplete tasks due this week"
2. "Create a new task in the Marketing project assigned to me"
3. "List all sections in the Product Launch project"
4. "Show me the status of the Q2 Planning project"

## Requirements

1. A compatible MCP client (Claude.ai, Cursor, or any application that has implemented an MCP client)
2. The app named "Asana MCP" is not blocked via
   Asana [app management](https://help.asana.com/s/article/app-management-and-integrations?language=en_US). If you're
   not sure if the app is blocked, try to connect your MCP client to the server and go through the authorization flow.
   You'll either be able to authorize the app like normal or, if the app is currently blocked, be prompted to send a
   request for your admin to unblock the app for your domain.

## Available tools

Asana's MCP server includes 30+ tools for:

1. Project tracking and status updates
2. Task creation and management
3. User information
4. Getting updates on Goals
5. Team organization
6. Quick Asana object searching via typeahead

# Connecting to Asana's MCP Server

The Asana MCP server is available at: `https://mcp.asana.com/sse`

This server requires authentication with your Asana account. When connecting, you will be prompted to authorize the
application to access your Asana data.

> üìò Allowlist
>
> Due to the implementation of an OAuth redirect URI allowlist, some third-party applications might require additional
> configuration or registration of their redirect URI with Asana Support before a successful connection can be
> established. If you‚Äôre a maintainer of an MCP client,
> see [Integrating with Asana's MCP Server](/docs/integrating-with-asanas-mcp-server) for details on how to register.

## Using with Claude.ai

_Note: Requires Claude Enterprise or Teams, and the connection must be set up by a Workspace Owner or Primary Owner in
Claude before users will be able to connect_

### For Claude.ai Admins

_Only Workspace Owners and Primary Owners can set up MCP server connections in Claude.ai:_

1. Go to Settings in Claude.ai
2. Navigate to the "Integrations" section
3. Click "Add server"
4. Enter "Asana" as the Name
5. Enter `https://mcp.asana.com/sse` as the Server URL
6. Click "Add server"
7. Authenticate with your Asana account via OAuth
8. Select which Asana tools to enable for your workspace
9. Click "Save"

### For Claude.ai Users

After your admin has set up the integration:

1. Navigate to claude.ai
2. Click on the tools menu (next to the search icon)
3. Select "Asana" from the list of available integrations
4. If this is your first time using the integration, you'll be prompted to authenticate
5. Once authenticated, you can start using Claude with Asana

## Using with Cursor

1. Go to your Cursor editor's settings ("Settings" > "Cursor Settings")
2. "MCP" > "+ Add new global MCP server" OR "Tools & Integrations" > "New MCP Server"
3. Add the following to your `mcp.json`:
   ```json
           "asana": {
               "command": "npx",
               "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.asana.com/sse"]
           }
   ```
4. Save your `mcp.json`file. If this is your first time using the integration, you'll be prompted to authenticate  
   **NOTE: **If you run into `Internal Server Error`you can delete your local `~/.mcp-auth`directory
   `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth`.  
   **WARNING:** if you have other applications that might be using this directory `~/.mcp-auth` you will need to
   re-auth (**EX:** other applications that use `mcp-remote`)
5. Once authenticated, you can start using Cursor with Asana

## Using with other supported MCP Clients

For MCP-compatible clients:

1. Configure your client to connect to `https://mcp.asana.com/sse`
2. Ensure your client supports OAuth authentication
3. Set up the connection according to your client's documentation
4. Authenticate with your Asana account when prompted
5. Select which Asana tools to enable based on your needs

## Using with ChatGPT

We're excited about the potential for ChatGPT to connect with Asana's MCP server and actively exploring this
integration! ChatGPT requires some additional tools we do not yet support, please check back soon for updates.

## Allowing / Blocking Asana's MCP Server

Customers in Asana's Enterprise+ tier may
use [Asana's App Management](https://help.asana.com/s/article/app-management-and-integrations?language=en_US) to allow
or block the **Asana MCP** app. This action will apply to _all_ MCP clients. Customers in other tiers may contact Asana
Support to block the **Asana MCP** app. Super admins must make the support request.

## Troubleshooting

1. If authentication fails, try logging out of your Asana account and logging back in. If that does not address the
   issue or you see a ‚ÄúClient not found‚Äù error, try removing the Asana MCP integration within your client and adding it
   back.
2. Ensure your MCP client supports SSE-based servers (not Streamable HTTP)
3. If you‚Äôre still not able to connect or are seeing an`invalid_redirect_uri` error, reach out to the maintainer of the
   app you‚Äôre using for help (
   see [Integrating with Asana's MCP Server](https://developers.asana.com/docs/integrating-with-asanas-mcp-server))
4. Check that your client can handle OAuth authentication flows
5. Verify you have the necessary permissions in your Asana workspace
